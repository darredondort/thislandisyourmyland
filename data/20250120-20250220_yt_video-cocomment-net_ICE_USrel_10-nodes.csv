He had no idea that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers planned to meet him there. Police said the man had smelled of alcohol after he rear-ended another car, causing minor damage and no injuries, at a stoplight in December. Prosecutors were not seeking a jail sentence. But Judge Clay Stucki broke the news: The man would not be allowed to leave the courthouse — for a reason that had nothing to do with his case. ICE agents were waiting for him. The man took a step back, slowly shook his head and looked toward the ground. ”I personally feel bad that we’re going to have to take you into custody. That isn’t my choice or decision, but it’s something under federal law that I’m going to have to follow,” Stucki said. The man’s wife, seated with his daughter near the back of the room, put her hand to her head. The judge told The Salt Lake Tribune he had not been aware in advance that ICE planned to appear in the courtroom that day. The hearing occurred a week after ICE — in a change from what policy had been under the Biden administration — broadened the circumstances under which it will pursue undocumented immigrants in or near courthouses. Stucki said he worries that any increased ICE enforcement inside courthouses could cause a chilling effect, deterring people from showing up for scheduled court appearances. That could lead to warrants for their arrest or other consequences. “Justice courts certainly are not immigration courts, and none of us right now are probably well acquainted with how immigration law and immigration enforcement fits in, especially with the small misdemeanors that the justice courts handle,” Stucki said. He added that he hopes things work out well for the defendant, who was given the time to enter a plea and resolve his case. The arrest “was, I’m sure, traumatic for him and his family,” Stucki said. “But I do appreciate the ICE agents tried to allow us to make it as least traumatic as possible.” Read more at https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/02/05/utah-man-unexpectedly-taken-into/ Video from Ogden City Justice Court Reporting by Brock Marchant | The Salt Lake Tribune",129,"Politics,Society",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9YItdPG4xIE/maxresdefault.jpg,128,402,2,C,ICE makes surprise arrest of immigrant in a Utah courthouse,ICE makes surprise arrest immigrant Utah courthouse,2.15,00:02:09,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YItdPG4xIE,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZj3_eWQ4f4oHm_x-wsxG7Q

Reuters witnessed the arrest, which took place at a Marathon Gas Station in Rex, Georgia, after agents had staked out the area. Corral-Reyes was quickly surrounded by agents and placed into an unmarked law enforcement vehicle. During the operation, officers said they discovered a firearm in his vehicle and ammunition in his pocket. Kristen Sullivan, the Atlanta Deputy Field Office Director for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said Corral-Reyes had previously been arrested on multiple charges including driving under the influence and reckless conduct involving a firearm. An arrest record sent to Reuters showed criminal convictions for Corral-Reyes, including shoplifting, driving under the influence (DUI) and simple assault, dating back to 2002. “In this situation, when he was arrested by the local police and when they interviewed him, he admitted that he was from Mexico,” Sullivan said.

Not always! While permanent residents aren’t typically targeted, certain violations can put you at risk of deportation. ⚠️ ❌ Reasons Green Card Holders Face Deportation: 🔹 Using your green card as a tourist visa—staying outside the U.S. for over a year can cost you your residency. 🔹 Criminal charges—even minor offenses can have serious immigration consequences. ALWAYS speak to an immigration attorney! 🔹 Conditional residents—if you fail to file Form I-751 to remove conditions on time (or if it’s denied), you could lose your status. 👍 Don’t forget to like, comment, and subscribe for more insights into U.S. immigration laws!

The crowd grew to a few thousand people who marched to City Hall, before many walked onto the freeway near the Alameda Street exit shortly after noon. Police reported at 1:19 p.m. that the demonstration had moved back onto surface streets, opening both north and southbound lanes of the freeway. Several minutes later officials said the protesters had moved back onto the freeway.

Protesters waved flags and signs as passing drivers honked. Eventually, a large box of fireworks was placed and set off in the middle of the intersection. Police formed a riot line and began issuing verbal commands to the protesters to clear the intersection. A firework was then thrown at the officers. Officers began retreating to the north, leaving several patrol cars unattended. Several protesters began damaging the police cars before a person entered and drove off in one police vehicle down the street before fleeing on foot (5:58 on the video timestamp).

In this exclusive video report, she’s joined by photojournalist Matthew McDermont, capturing the reality of ICE officers doing the grueling work of “knock and talks.” They’re targeting the “worst of the worst” migrant criminals, many of whom are believed to be part of the notorious Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. ICE faces numerous challenges, including a negative public reputation. Kennedy called it an “uphill battle” and compared it to “needles in a haystack,” as there are roughly 11 million undocumented people living in the US. #ice #chicago #raids #migrants #crime The New York Post is your source for breaking news, news about New York, sports, business, entertainment, opinion, real estate, culture, fashion, and more.

Specifically, how targets were identified, prioritized, approached and taken into custody.

Immigrant communities and their allies say the raids violate human rights, the Constitution, and are being carried out in retaliation against sanctuary cities that have policies aimed at protecting undocumented residents. In Chicago, immigrant rights organizer Dulce Guzmán says there is ""palpable fear and anxiety among families,"" but she lauds elected officials, including Mayor Brandon Johnson and Governor J.B. Pritzker, for pushing back against what she says is the Trump administration's ""white supremacist agenda."" Meanwhile, in Newark, New Jersey, Mayor Ras Baraka has condemned an ICE raid last week at a seafood depot where federal agents took three people into custody, including a U.S. military veteran. ""Simply being in proximity to their target, which is immigrant communities, is enough to arrest and detain you, too,"" says Amy Torres, executive director of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice. She encourages people to know their rights, such as the ability to record ICE agents and to refuse orders without a warrant. ""One of their most effective tools is fear and panic,"" Torres says.

Walmart, Costco, Home Depot y otras cadenas están experimentando un fenómeno que nunca antes habían visto: pasillos vacíos, empleados desaparecidos y una crisis que crece cada día. Los inmigrantes, en respuesta al miedo a las detenciones masivas, han dejado sus trabajos y han reducido su presencia en espacios públicos. Y ahora, las mismas empresas que antes apoyaban las políticas de Trump, están rogando que esto pare. La ironía es brutal. Durante años, las grandes corporaciones financiaron discursos contra la migración, pero ahora que se están quedando sin trabajadores ni clientes, están sintiendo el golpe en su bolsillo. ¿Podrá la economía soportar este impacto o estamos viendo el principio de un colapso provocado por el propio gobierno? Los datos son claros: en apenas una semana, ICE ha detenido a miles de personas, los negocios están en crisis y la presión sobre la Casa Blanca no deja de aumentar. En este episodio, analizamos el impacto real de estas redadas, los números que muestran el efecto económico inmediato y las declaraciones de empresarios que, irónicamente, ahora ven en la migración la única forma de salvar sus negocios. ¿Trump podrá sostener esta política o la presión de Wall Street lo obligará a dar marcha atrás?",2664,"Politics,Society",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XmWegcu8uMs/maxresdefault.jpg,17,26,5,F,INMIGRANTES PARALIZAN WALMART: REDADAS DE ICE DEJAN TIENDAS VACIAS | TheMXFam,INMIGRANTES PARALIZAN WALMART REDADAS DE ICE DEJAN TIENDAS VACIAS TheMXFam,44.4,00:44:24,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmWegcu8uMs,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKNW2TrrUlof4ES2y1BWjpA

ICE didn’t come for his students; but instead, the school district came for him. He was suspended immediately, subjected to an investigation, and will almost certainly be terminated. Meanwhile, his community has shown overwhelming support to immigrants. That support is now being expressed in cities across the country. In fact, pro-immigrant activism has actually made it difficult to carry out mass deportations. Tom Homan, Trump’s Border Czar, said their job has been made more difficult since so many people know their rights. In this video we’ll talk about the Texas teacher as well as Trump’s mass deportation agenda and the propaganda surrounding it. **Important Resource** Know Your Rights (Courtesy of the ACLU) - https://www.aclu-or.org/en/know-your-rights-immigrants-rights Sources: NBC News - https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/public-schools-undocumented-students-trump-immigration-raids-rcna189466 Washington Post - https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/01/26/ice-arrests-raids-trump-quota/ CBS News - https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/ice-raid-newark-new-jersey-business/ Videos: Fox 4 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaiU6iKKVs0&list=RDNSRaiU6iKKVs0&start_radio=1 CNN - https://x.com/jallallacompa/status/1884253446905438559 ABC News - https://www.mediaite.com/news/abcs-martha-raddatz-grills-border-czar-tom-homan-on-immigration-raids-in-testy-battle-you-gonna-go-into-elementary-schools/ Democracy Now! - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwQXD5WECrw MSNBC - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNLFKPHR91U ************** Support the Show: Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/humanistreport YouTube Membership: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7Q4rvzJDbHeBHYk5rnvZeA/join Membership via PayPal: http://www.humanistreport.com/support.html ************** Mike's Book, 'Catalyze' is Now Available on All Major Retailers!

The crackdown is blurring the lines between reality, rumor and performance — reshaping daily life in immigrant communities, even when enforcement never arrives. ✍️: Jamiles Lartey & 🎥: Chris Vazquez / The Marshall Project Transcript: IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT: We’ve arrested thousands of immigrants. CHRIS VAZQUEZ: Really? IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT: Yeah, we averaged more than 800 arrests per day during Trump’s first 10 days in office. A NEW YORK TIMES ANALYSIS: That’s more than double the daily average of the last eight years. CHRIS: Yeah, I know immigration arrests have spiked under Trump. IMMIGRATION DATA EXPERTS: But we’re skeptical of how much you say they’ve spiked. You’re releasing information way faster than usual, and leaving out details. Like where these arrests happened or whether the people you arrested are being detained, deported or released. CHRIS 2: And reports of raids are reshaping lives in immigrant communities, even when those reports aren’t true. Like in New Jersey, the owners of a Salvadorian restaurant lost tons of business after a false TikTok about a raid there. CHRIS 1: So false reports and publicity are drumming up fear, but there has been a real increase in enforcement, right? CHRIS 2: Right. And one reason seems to be more “collateral arrests.” NPR JOURNALISTS: This has looked like raids targeting migrants with criminal records while also detaining other people nearby. NBC NEWS JOURNALISTS: On one day in late January, nearly half of the 1,200 migrants arrested didn’t have criminal records. CHRIS 2: So there are reports of immigrants avoiding public spaces because of all this. But not everywhere. TRUMP’S BORDER CZAR: I’m frustrated at how well some immigrants in Chicago have been educated on how to defy and hide from ICE. IMMIGRANT RIGHTS ACTIVISTS: Which we’re proud of.",58,"Politics,Society",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JT1stG_gSXY/maxresdefault.jpg,11,12,3,D,ICE arrests are up.
